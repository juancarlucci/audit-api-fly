This is the backend service for the Accessibly Yours project. It provides a RESTful API that runs real-time accessibility audits on provided URLs and returns structured JSON results. It is designed to be hosted on Fly.io to enable use of Puppeteer in a full Linux container.

== Motivation

Why Fly.io?

- ❌ Vercel serverless functions cannot run headless Chromium out of the box.
- ✅ Fly.io supports full Docker-based containers with root access and custom dependencies.
- 👷 Ideal for hosting a small Express API that uses `pa11y`, which depends on headless browsers.

== Tech Stack

- Express.js server
- Puppeteer via `pa11y`
- Deployed using Docker on Fly.io

== Endpoint

[GET] `/audit?url=https://example.com`

Returns:

```json
{
  "documentTitle": "Example Site",
  "pageUrl": "https://example.com",
  "issues": [
    {
      "code": "WCAG2AA.Principle1.Guideline1_3...",
      "message": "Fieldset does not contain a legend...",
      "selector": "#main-content > form"
    }
  ]
}
```

== Development

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

== Deployment

1. `flyctl launch` to create the app
2. `fly deploy` to push the Docker image
3. Verify live at: https://audit-api-fly-01.fly.dev/audit?url=https://wikipedia.org

== Files

- `server.js`: Entry point; sets up Express server and routes
- `Dockerfile`: Uses Playwright base image for Chromium compatibility
- `fly.toml`: Fly.io app configuration (port, region, etc.)

== Lessons Learned

- Puppeteer requires headless Chrome to be bundled or installed; Docker image solved this
- Using Fly.io gave full control over the environment vs. serverless abstraction
- CORS must be enabled to allow frontend to fetch audit results

== Features

- ✅ In-memory caching for frequent URL audits
- ✅ Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP)
- ✅ CORS enabled for cross-origin requests

== Future Work

- Support batch auditing (multiple URLs)
- Implement persistent caching
- Add API key authentication
- Support custom Pa11y configurations

== Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- 100 requests per IP address
- 15 minute window
- Returns 429 status code when limit is exceeded
